# Claude Code Frontend Design Skill

This skill enables creation of high-quality, distinctive web interfaces that prioritize intentional aesthetic direction over generic AI design patterns.

## Core Purpose
"Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality" for components, pages, and applications while avoiding predictable AI aesthetics.

## Design Process
The skill emphasizes understanding context first—identifying the interface's purpose, target audience, and tone. Designers should commit to a bold aesthetic direction (minimalist, maximalist, retro, organic, brutalist, etc.) before implementing code.

## Key Implementation Principles

**Typography & Visuals**: Use characterful, distinctive fonts rather than defaults. Pair display fonts with refined body text. Establish cohesive color palettes using CSS variables with dominant colors and sharp accents.

**Motion & Interaction**: Prioritize CSS-only animations for HTML, emphasizing impactful page-load sequences with staggered reveals over scattered micro-interactions. Incorporate scroll-triggering and hover effects.

**Spatial Design**: Employ asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements, and generous negative space (or controlled density) for unexpected layouts.

**Atmospheric Details**: Add contextual visual effects—gradient meshes, textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, and custom elements—that strengthen the aesthetic.

## Prohibited Approaches
The guidelines explicitly reject "generic AI-generated aesthetics" including overused typefaces, clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients), predictable layouts, and "cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character."

The skill emphasizes that code complexity should match aesthetic ambition: maximalist designs require elaborate animations; minimalist designs demand precision in spacing and typography.
